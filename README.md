## Welcome to predicting house prices repository

### Introduction 
Our team's objective is to the use the price range of HDB flats offered by data.gov.sg and  help individuals who are looking to buy or sell a home to make informed decisions. For example, a home buyer can use a house price prediction model to estimate the value of a property and negotiate the price with the seller. Similarly, a home seller can use a house price prediction model to determine the right price for their property, helping them sell their home quickly and at a fair price.


### Data Processing
Data processing is an important step in machine learning that involves transforming raw data into a form that is suitable for analysis and modeling. In this code, three types of data processing are used: data cleaning, one-hot encoding and dropping columns.

- Data cleaning is the first step in data preprocessing, which involves removing missing or inconsistent data, duplicate values, and irrelevant features. Data cleaning is crucial as it ensures that the data used in the analysis is accurate and complete, which in turn improves the quality of the results.

- One-hot encoding is used to convert categorical variables into numerical features that can be used in a machine learning model. Categorical variables are variables that have a limited number of values or categories, such as "room_type" and "town". One-hot encoding creates new binary variables for each category, indicating whether or not a particular category is present in a given data point.

- Dropping columns is used to remove columns that are not needed or are redundant. In this code, the original "room_type" and "town" columns are dropped after one-hot encoding because they are no longer needed.
